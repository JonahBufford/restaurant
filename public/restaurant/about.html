    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <img src="../images/garden.jpg" alt="Picture of garden beds" class="headerimg">
    <br>
    <p>We are a worker-owned coop, dedicated to serving high-quality vegan food produced by local
    sources, located in Queen Anne, Seattle.</p>
    <p>We believe that urban agriculture is incredibly important. Locally grown food reduces
    carbon dioxide in the air, and saves energy that would be consumed in transportation.
    Additionally, community gardens give people more power to feed themselves in a healthy way.
    Because of this, we grow much of our own food (seasonal fruits and vegetables, as well as
    chestnuts), and find what we can't grow from local sources. Additionally, we donate all of our
    profits to local initiatives that build community gardens.</p>
    <p>To avoid waste, we distribute all unused food at the end of the day to unhoused people living
    nearby.</p>
